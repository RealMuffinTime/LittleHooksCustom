# LittleHooksCustom
Discord webhooks integration as a Spigot plugin. Extremely light weight. \
This is a tiny fork of [LittleHooks](https://github.com/Pequla/LittleHooks), to make it not dependent on LittleLink. \
Minecraft chat messages are now also posted, and it does not use Discord Embeds anymore. 

> Does not require plugin [LittleLink](https://github.com/Pequla/LittleLink)

## Configuration

The default configuration:
```yaml
webhook-url: url
```

- `webhook-url` is the webhook url. You can obtain it in the channel settings under the integrations/webhooks tab. Please note that this link allows you to send messages to that channel so keep it safe and secure
